 43-46: Answer these questions according to the
 passage below.
 The question of animal language and thought has been
 debated since ancient times. Some have held the
 view that humans are exceptional in these respects,
 while others believe that humans and animals are
 similar with respect to language and thought. The issue
 is important because our self-image as a species is at
 stake. Arguments for human exceptionalism such as
 Cartesian, Wittgensteinian and behaviourist state that
 language and thought are closely associated, and
 animals do not have language. The ape language
 experiments of the 1960s and 1970s were especially
 important against this background: if apes could learn
 language then even the advocates of human
 exceptionalism would have to admit that they have
 thoughts. It is now generally believed that whatever
 linguistic abilities apes have shown have been quite
 rudimentary. Yet many sceptics are willing to grant that
 in some cases apes did develop linguistic skills to some
 extent, and clearly evidenced thought. Studies of other
 animals in captivity and various animals in the wild have
 provided evidence of highly sophisticated
 communicative behaviour. Cognitive ethology and
 comparative psychology have emerged as the fields that
 study animal thought. While there are conceptual
 difficulties in grounding these fields, it appears plausible
 that many animals have thoughts and these can be
 scientifically investigated.   
43.

 According to the passage, the issue of animal
 language is significant because ----.

 language
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 A)
 the fact that apes are able to think just like humans do
 the assumption that animal behaviour is closely
 connected to their thoughts
 an idea that there is a strong link between language
 and thought
 a behaviourist approach to language learning
 It can be inferred from the passage that ----.
 captive and wild animals differ greatly in how they
 communicate
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 A)
 wild animals are better at developing ways of
 communication than captive animals
 there is a significant lack of study of animal thought
 and communication
 studies of animals in captivity fail to provide any
 evidence of their ability to think
 whether captive or wild, many animals may exhibit
 sophisticated communicational behaviour
 Which of the following can be said about the author
 of the passage?
 He seems to be of the opinion that there are many
 animals with the ability to think.
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 He supports the philosophical views that regard
 humans as the highest of species.
 He clearly states that investigating animal intelligence

 He does not accept the idea that humans and animals
 can be investigated on one scale.
 He endorses the idea that human beings’ self-image

 47-50: Answer these questions according to the
 passage below.
 Risk is inherent in all business activity. Start-ups, for
 example, face the risk of too few customers, and
 therefore insufficient revenue to cover costs. There is
 also the risk that a competitor will copy the company’s
 idea, and perhaps offer a better alternative. When a
 company has borrowed money from a bank, there is a
 risk that interest rates will rise, and repayments will
 become too burdensome to afford. Start-ups that rely on
 overseas trade are also exposed to exchange-rate risk.
 Moreover, new businesses in particular may be exposed
 to the risk of operating in only one market. Whereas
 large companies often diversify their operations to
 spread risk, the success of small companies is often
 linked to the success of one idea (the original genesis
 for the start-up) or one geographic region, such as the
 local area. A decline in that market or area can lead to
 failure. It is essential that new businesses are mindful of
 market changes, and position themselves to adapt to
 those changes. At its heart, risk is a strategic issue.
 Business owners must carefully weigh the operational
 risk of a start-up, or the risks of a new product or
 project, against potential profits or losses – in other
 words, the strategic consequences of action vs.
 inaction. Risk must be quantified and managed; and it
 poses a constant strategic challenge. Fortune favours
 the brave, but with people’s lives and the success of the
 business at stake, caution cannot simply be thrown to
 the wind.

 Which of the following is not
 A)

 51-54: Answer these questions according to the
 passage below.
 Neanderthals could hold objects between finger and
 thumb like we would hold a pen because their hands
 were more nimble, able to move quickly and easily.
 Recent findings suggest that Neanderthals were able to
 perform skilful tasks like threading sea shells onto string
 to make jewellery. These activities were hard to explain
 if they were clumsy. Neanderthal hand bones were
 much chunkier than ours, implying a lack of fine control.
 Previous studies suggested Neanderthals were unable
 to perform a ‘precision grip’ with finger and thumb.
 Instead, they were thought to use a ‘power
 grip’ involving their whole fist like small children holding
 crayons. To find out how Neanderthals used their
 hands, Katerina Harvati at the University of Tübingen,
 Germany studied 3D scans of ‘entheses’: the points on
 the bones where muscles were attached. A precision
 grip uses a different set of muscles to a power grip, and
 those muscles that get used more result in larger
 entheses. Harvati’s team previously showed this by
 studying modern humans having done different jobs.
 They examined the hand entheses of Neanderthals and
 early modern humans. The Neanderthals spent most of
 their time using precision grips, while the early modern
 humans used both precision and power grips. “Our
 study reconciles
 the archaeological with the anatomical
 fossil evidence,” says Harvati. “It was previously
 proposed Neanderthals relied on force for their manual
 activities”, but this perception “was at odds with
 mounting archaeological evidence for sophisticated
 cultural behaviour of Neanderthals”.

 55-58: Answer these questions according to the
 passage below.
 US statistics taken from between 2000 and 2009 show
 that car drivers or passengers suffer 7.3 deaths per
 billion miles. In contrast, air travel comes in at just 0.07
 deaths per billion passenger miles. Of course, statistics
 cannot cure someone’s fear of flying, but they do prove
 that it is one of the safest ways to get from A to B. This
 safety is thanks to the testing that every single part of
 the aircraft has to go through before it is allowed to
 undertake its first flight. While passengers get to enjoy
 the comfort of air conditioning, the engines have to be
 able to cope with temperatures as low as -55 ºC during
 cruise conditions. Temperature tests are important to
 the airlines because they want to make sure that their
 planes can operate in as many environments as
 possible. Each time they have to ground an aircraft
 because of bad weather, they lose money. Another thing
 to be considered by the airlines is the migrating birds.
 They can travel at altitudes of over 8,000m and threaten
 the cruise phase of the flight, although the greatest risk
 is during take-off, when the craft is at its heaviest and
 the engines are close to maximum power. 
55.
 A)
 It is pointed out in the passage that according to the
 statistics ----.
 air travel is more popular than ever, especially in the
 USA
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 the number of people afraid of air travel is increasing
 transportation is safer by plane than by car
 the number of deaths in air travel is increasing
 people die of the fear of flights, not of air crashes
 56.
 57.
 58.
 A)
 According to the passage, the safety of each flight is
 ensured by ----.
 supplying powerful engines
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 A)
 having skilled aircraft crew
 the tests before the flights
 less traffic in the air
 having fewer passengers
 According to the passage, temperature is important
 in air travel because ----.
 bad weather conditions can result in loss of money for
 the airlines
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 temperatures as low as -55 ºC are the main cause of
 plane crashes
 the air conditioning in aircrafts is not effective at low
 temperatures
 it can affect the speed of the planes leading to delays
 in flights
 passengers generally prefer to fly in good weather
 conditions
 One can understand from the passage that birds ----.
 are responsible for the majority of air travel deaths
 are a bigger danger to planes than low temperatures 
threaten the safety of the flight mostly during the initial
 stages of the flight
 can prevent the engines from reaching their maximum
 power
 are most dangerous at altitudes higher than 8,000m

 59-62: Answer these questions according to the
 passage below.
 What makes for a long-lasting memory? Research has
 shown that emotional or important events become
 deeply rooted, whereas neutral ones create weak
 impressions that easily fade. But what about an
 experience that initially seemed forgettable but was later
 shown to be important? Animal research suggested that
 these types of older memories could be strengthened,
 but until now scientists had not been able to replicate
 these findings in humans. New evidence suggests that
 our initially weak memories are maintained by the brain
 for a set period of time, during which they can be
 enhanced. In a recent study, psychologists at New York
 University showed 119 participants a set of images of
 tools and animals. A few minutes later the subjects saw
 a new set of images, with an electric shock paired with
 either tools or animals to increase the salience of
 one category. The participants' memories for both sets
 of images were then tested either six hours later, or the
 next day. Participants remembered images from the first
 series better if they belonged to the same category that
 was later paired with a shock. The findings suggest that
 even if an event does not seem meaningful when it
 occurs, a later cue signalling that the experience was
 important can enhance the old memory.
 59.
 A)
 According to the passage, in order for memories to
 be deeply rooted, they should be ----.
 paired with a physical stimulus
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 accompanied by stimulating feelings 
linked to the ones that are initially strong 
broadly categorised in the brain before they are lost 
replicated immediately after they are created
 60.
 61.
 62.
 A)
 It is pointed out in the passage that weak memories----.
 can be strengthened but they cannot be as permanent
 as initially strong ones
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 A)
 remain in the brain only if they are replicated on a daily
 basis
 can be better remembered if they are connected to
 initially strong ones
 are bound to disappear eventually, even if they are
 repeated
 are kept in the brain for some time before they are
 forgotten
 Which of the following is true about the study done
 by New York University psychologists?
 Accompanying an image in the second set with an
 electric shock facilitated recollection of the ones in the
 same category in the first set. 
B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 The participants remembered as many images from
 the second series as from the first one when asked on
 the same day or the next day.
 The memory experiment tested humans' neural
 reactions to a set of images of animals and tools.
 The study provided evidence for how memories can be
 manipulated to alter reality. 
The researchers accompanied the images of tools with
 an electric shock to make the tool category distinct.
 What does the passage mainly focus on?
 How new experiences boost initially weak memories
 How humans react psychologically to different images
 When a memory is susceptible to weakening
 What types of feedback can strengthen memories
 Whether positive outcomes improve long-term
 memory

 Daniel:
  In my Humanities course this week, we’re learning
 about common American hobbies. One such
 hobby is coin collecting. 
Beth:
  That sounds strange and uncommon. Why would
 someone have a hobby such as coin collecting? 
Daniel:
 ----
 Beth: 
 Well, it’s true that coins represent changes in
 trade as well as in international relations.
 However, it still seems like a strange hobby to
 me. 
A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 I’m not sure why someone would have a hobby like
 this. Perhaps people with large collections feel more
 powerful than those without.
 Some would argue that coin collecting is related to
 history and economics. Therefore, this hobby covers a
 wide range of interests.
 My father grew up in America and he collected coins
 because he wanted to learn about metals.
 The reasons behind our hobbies are sometimes
 unexplainable. I do know that people appreciate
 money, so that could be why.
 Our professor asked us that same question. I’m going
 to think about possible reasons this week.

 Do you mean harsh penalties or increasing ecological
 taxes?
 I believe that more efforts should be made to increase
 public awareness of natural catastrophes. Would you

 Elizabeth:
  Did you know that the rise of drug-resistant
 bacteria due to overprescription of antibiotics
 kills nearly one million people a year around the
 world?
 Philip:
 ----
 Elizabeth:
  To address this, the UK government offered local
 health bodies an extra £5 in funding per patient if
 they cut prescribing antibiotics.
 Philip:
  Did it really work?
 Elizabeth:
  Well, one study has found that general
 practitioners began writing 3% fewer antibiotic
 prescriptions for respiratory infections.
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 Some family doctors in Australia and the UK use
 tests before they prescribe antibiotics.
 Yeah that’s right, and many doctors unnecessarily
 prescribe the drugs for viral infections as well.
 Fortunately, doctors have been successfully nudged to
 cut antibiotic use in recent years.
 To be honest, governments should try raising
 patients´ awareness rather than interfering with the
 doctor’s business.
 I heard that an initiative to curb the overuse of
 antibiotics was introduced, which dramatically lowered
 the rates.

 Student:
  Well I like the topic because how people interpret

 Wouldn’t it be better if you also mention the
 mainstream culture in different societies to illustrate
 the common features of cultured people?
 Why do you consider it as an issue worth discussing in
 detail? Isn’t it clear what we expect to find in
 these people?
 Are you also interested in the definition of cultural
 events since it may provide clues about who to
 include as cultured or not?
 Do you find cultured people who attend talks,

 Although it is incorrect to characterise adolescence 
as a time of inevitable family conflict, early
 adolescence is a period of significant change in
 family relationships.
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 Early adolescence is a period of serious change in
 family relationships, so it may be wrongly considered
 as a time when frequent disagreements arise in the
 family.
 Early adolescence refers to a period of substantial
 change in family relationships; however, it would be
 wrong to characterise adolescence as a time when
 unavoidable family disputes occur.
 As adolescence is a time when inescapable family
 arguments break out, early adolescence is mistakenly
 believed to result in critical change in family
 relationships.
 Whereas early adolescence is regarded as a period
 during which family relationships undergo remarkable
 change, adolescence is incorrectly considered as a
 time when family disputes become more intense.
 Even though early adolescence is incorrectly 
characterised as a period of dramatic change in family
 relationships, adolescence is generally seen as a time 
when unavoidable family arguments occur frequently.

 If the benefits of zoos are negligible, animal
 advocates contend, then, keeping wildlife captive
 cannot be justified.
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 According to animal advocates, keeping wildlife
 captive is not justifiable even though zoos have
 several benefits.
 Despite the proven benefits of zoos, animal advocates
 believe that keeping wildlife captive is not justifiable.
 Animal advocates think that it is not possible to justify
 keeping wildlife captive unless there are significant
 benefits to be gained from the zoos.
 Animal advocates suggest that justifying the need to
 keep wildlife captive in zoos depends on how much
 benefit they offer.
 Regardless of the benefits of zoos, keeping wildlife
 captive is unacceptable for animal advocates to justify.
 Communicative development in the first year of
 all infants occurs in the same way, regardless of the
 complexity of the language being acquired.
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 While communicative development in the first year of
 all infants takes place in a similar way, the complexity
 of the language being acquired may impact this
 development.
 The complexity of an infant’s language determines
 whether he or she can learn to communicate more
 easily than others in his or her first year.
 Although some infants have a language that is more
 complex than those of others, their communicative
 development in their first year could occur more
 quickly.
 No matter how complicated their language is, every
 infant goes through the same process of
 communicative development in their first year.
 The complexity of the language being acquired has
 nothing to do with the communicative development in
 the first year of an infant, though it seems to do so.

 Neuroscientists know a lot about how individual
 neurons operate but remarkably little about how
 large numbers of them work together to produce
 thoughts, feelings and behaviours.
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 Neuroscientists’ comprehensive understanding of the
 workings of individual neurons may contribute
 significantly to what they know about large numbers of
 neurons, which are thought to work in cooperation to
 produce thoughts, feelings and behaviours.
 As they already know how neurons behave
 individually, what neuroscientists need to focus more
 on is how large neuron groups collaborate to produce
 thoughts, feelings and behaviours. 
Neuroscientists are knowledgeable enough about
 how individual neurons function during the production
 of thought, feelings, and behaviours, but they know
 little about how large numbers of neurons perform
 these duties.
 Neuroscientists’ knowledge of how large numbers of
 neurons cooperate for the production of thoughts,
 feelings and behaviours is rather limited despite the
 fact that they have vast knowledge of how individual
 neurons work.
 Neuroscientists have already discovered enough
 about the functioning of individual neurons, and now
 they need to expand their knowledge of how
 large neuron groups produce thoughts, feelings and
 behaviours.

 Sleep is a period of intense neurological activity,
 especially when we have dreams. ---- Many
 researchers think that dreams could be an
 unintended consequence of these and other
 underlying neurological processes. Harvard
 psychiatrists propose that as brain circuits become
 active during the night, they trigger sensations,
 emotions and memories, all of which are essentially
 random. But our meaning-making brains still
 assemble all of this underlying activity into a story,
 often a strange or illogical one.
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 One of its main functions may be to allow the brain to
 consolidate and organise our memories.
 Deciphering nocturnal symbols may be enjoyable, but
 in reality, it is much more complicated than it seems.
 Scientific theories are more sceptical than dream
 dictionaries about how much dreams actually reveal.
 Dreaming has recently been seen as something that
 opens a window to the working of the mind.
 Dream interpretations seem relevant to our lives
 because they apply equally well to almost everybody.
 73.
 Infants can recognise the emotions of others, and
 use this information when reacting to novel
 situations and people. As infants explore their
 world, they generally rely on the emotional
 expressions of their mothers or caregivers to
 determine the safety or appropriateness of a
 particular endeavour. ---- Are infants simply
 imitating their mother’s emotional responses, or do
 they actually experience a change in mood purely
 from the expressive visual cues of the mother?
 What is known, however, is that as infants explore
 their environment, their emotional responses to
 what they encounter are based on cues portrayed by
 their mother or primary caregiver. 
A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 During the second year, infants express emotions of
 shame or embarrassment and pride, which are greatly
 developed with the help of adults.
 Parents, however, are one of the primary sources that
 socialise children to communicate emotional
 experience in culturally specific ways.
 Some scientists claim that infants may fail to react to a
 threat in an appropriate way because it is usually
 difficult for them to appreciate inputs. 
Although this process has been established by several
 studies, there is some debate about how infants do it.
 Most infants, on the other hand, pay close attention to
 the events that take place in their environment,
 particularly after the first month.

 For centuries, people have bred microorganisms for
 the production of foods such as cheese and yogurt.
 Genetic technology takes this process a step further
 by manipulating specific genes for practical
 applications in research, medicine, and agriculture.
 The manipulation of genes resulted in hundreds of
 new products at the beginning of the 21st century.---- The tools used by scientists in this process
 include DNA-splitting enzymes and host organisms
 including a range of bacteria.
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 Usually, one gene prevails over the other and is thus
 called the dominant gene that supresses the other.
 Currently there are a number of technologies that use
 genetic engineering.
 Genes are individual segments of DNA within
 chromosomes and are known to affect all human
 traits.
 Reproduction entails a copy of a gene from the father
 and a gene from the mother joining together.
 Genes from different species are often combined by
 inserting a gene from one organism into another.

 Striving to eat healthily can, ironically, become an
 unhealthy obsession. People with the condition
 known as ‘orthorexia nervosa’ are fixated on
 consuming food in a way that they consider pure,
 clean or healthy to the point where their well-being
 suffers. They can, for example, become
 malnourished. ---- Some cut out entire food groups
 like fats or carbs. Orthorexia is not yet listed in
 psychiatric manuals, but it is described in scientific
 journals.
 A)
 B)
 C)
 D)
 E)
 The term ‘orthorexia nervosa’, which refers to
 a pathological fixation on eating only healthy foods,
 was coined by Steven Bratman, a Colorado physician.
 Experts generally link orthorexia with perfectionism,
 dieting, obsessive-compulsive traits and mental health
 struggles.
 That is because, as the disorder progresses, patients
 often become increasingly restrictive in what they will
 eat.
 If people cannot deal with such problems in a proper
 way, then it could be of high importance for them to
 talk to a mental health professional.
 Interestingly, and in contrast to many other eating
 disorders, gender does not seem to reduce the risk of
 getting orthorexia.

 groups. (II) Teachers can help reduce unrealistic fears
 by pointing out how common they are among people
 and what to do about them in order to reduce such fears
 by providing opportunities for students to practice alone
 or with one other student and then before increasingly
 larger groups. (III) Thus, students can practice speaking
 in front of their peers who face the same situation
 while presenting information, answering questions and
 holding group discussions. (IV) Students need to know
 how speakers differ from one another and how particular
 circumstances call for different forms of speech.
